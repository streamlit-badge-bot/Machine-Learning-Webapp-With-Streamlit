# Machine Learning Webapp With Streamlit
This project is based on Python Engineer's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klqn--Mu2pE). 

The purpose of this webapp is to use public dataset and create machine learning prediction with KNN, SVC, and Random Forest that is interactive. The interactivity allows use to choose the algorithm and change the Hyperparameter. It will then produce the accuracy of the prediction in real time.
